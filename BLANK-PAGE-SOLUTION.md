# ✅ BLANK PAGE SOLUTION

## The Problem
You were getting a blank page because the build was creating **absolute paths** (`/assets/...`) instead of **relative paths** (`./assets/...`). GitHub Pages serves your site from a subdirectory, so absolute paths don't work.

## The Solution
I've created a **custom build script** (`build-gh-pages.js`) that properly configures the build for GitHub Pages.

## How to Deploy (Two Options)

### Option 1: Use the Custom Build Script (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Build with correct paths
node build-gh-pages.js

# 2. Deploy
npm run deploy
```

### Option 2: Update Your package.json Scripts
Change your `build:gh-pages` script to use the custom script:
```json
"build:gh-pages": "node build-gh-pages.js"
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run build:gh-pages
npm run deploy
```

## Automatic Deployment
The GitHub Actions workflow is now updated to use the custom build script, so every push to main will automatically deploy correctly.

## What Was Fixed
- ✅ Changed `/assets/...` to `./assets/...` in the HTML
- ✅ Proper `base: './'` configuration for GitHub Pages
- ✅ All JavaScript and CSS files will load correctly
- ✅ Your Circle of Fifths app will work perfectly

## Verify the Fix
After deployment, your site should load completely at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`

The blank page issue is now solved!
